# Awair-uploader
This is a community based opensource tool that is capable of fetching data of Awair Element devices from Awair servers and send them to a custom endpoint.
The idea behind this project is to send these data to PlanetWatch servers in order to be able to be still elibile for rewards.

## Installation
Since the project is not yet approved by PlanetWatch Company, the software is basically only fetching data from Awair's servers. For the time being we discourage any usage of this project until PlanetWatch approves and shares the endpoints where to write our data.

If you still want to install this tool, just run clone the repository and run the following commands:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

If you want to create a standalone version of Awair-uploader, run the following commands:
```sh
npm run make
```

Stay tuned for next updates coming in the next days!
